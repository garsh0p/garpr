        GAR PR is a ranking system and tournament results archive for Super Smash Brothers Melee tournaments created by gaR, a player currently living in the Norcal area. gaR has abandoned us to work for YouTube, doing cool things in their gaming department, because he hates us. Therefore, several rougue developers have taken over the mantle, and have expanded the site to not only include other regions, but an admin interface for admins to manage regions. 

        We're currently under heavy developement, and are in something like a very closed beta. Progress is happening. 

         It is intended to be used by local and regional Smash communities to provide a point-based ranking for all players in the region. Most regional power rankings have historically been decided by a panel of players and only include a small subset of the player base (top 10, top 20, etc.). They are also updated fairly infrequently (a couple of times a year). GAR PR intends to provide a very frequently updated ranking that allows all players to see how they stack up against the rest of their region, no matter what their skill level is. In addition to providing rankings, GAR PR also provides match histories, allowing players to explore their full tournament history and local commentators to provide accurate insights on the history between two players.

    <h4>What rating system do you use?</h4>
    <p>Trueskill by Microsoft.</p>
    <h4>Where can I find out more about how Trueskill works?</h4>
    <p>
        Trueskill is a ranking system developed by Microsoft that is used for ranking players in many of their online Xbox Live titles. Check out the articles below to find out more about how Trueskill works:<br>

    <h4>What tournament programs do you support?</h4>
    <p>Tio or Challonge (with SmashGG in the works)</p>
    <h4>How do you handle inactive players?</h4>
    <p>A region determines activity criteria, which are X tournaments in the past Y days. If a player becomes inactive they become hidden from the rankings list. They will still maintain the same rating they had before they became inactive. Once they enter enough tournaments to become active again, their old rating will be used to calculate their new rating and they will reappear on the rankings. Note that there is no rating decay of any kind.</p>
    <h4>How do you handle the same player entering multiple tournaments with different tags?</h4>
    <p>Merging player results are handled manually, ideally during tournament import time, but players can always be manually merged later. If you notice any players that need to be merged, contact your regions admin please!</p>
    <h4>Do you take into account the set score (for example, 2-0 vs 2-1)?</h4>
    <p>No, only the match result (win or loss) is recorded.</p>
    <h4>Are round robin pools included?</h4>
    <p>When we have them available digitially, sure</p>
    <h4>How are out of region players handled?</h4>
    <p>Out of region players are handled just like any other player, except they are hidden permanently from the rankings list. They will still maintain a rating and match histories. A highly skilled out of region player entering a tournament in your region for the first time may have a slight effect on your rankings due to the player being treated as a brand new player, but their rating should converge fairly quickly as the tournament progresses.</p>
    <h4>Do you include majors (EVO, MLG, etc.) or other out-of-region tournaments that players in the region travel to?</h4>
    No. An out-of-region tournament would introduce too many out-of-region players, so the decision has been made to only include local tournaments.
    <h4>Can you include my region on GAR PR?</h4>
    <p>Definitely! Contact one of the devs, and we'll set you up with an admin account.</p>
    <h4>Is GAR PR open source?</h4>
    <p>Yup! <a href="https://github.com/ripgarpr/garpr">https://github.com/ripgarpr/garpr</a>. Development is ongoing, and we have an active slack. </p>
    <h4>Can you add &lt;insert feature here&gt;?</h4>
    <p>If you have any feature suggestions, feel free to file an feature suggestion in the issues section of our GitHub!</p>
