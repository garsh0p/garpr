        GAR PR is a ranking system and tournament results archive for Super Smash Brothers Melee tournaments created by gaR, a player currently living in the Norcal area. It is intended to be used by local and regional Smash communities to provide a point-based ranking for all players in the region. Most regional power rankings have historically been decided by a panel of players and only include a small subset of the player base (top 10, top 20, etc.). They are also updated fairly infrequently (a couple of times a year). GAR PR intends to provide a very frequently updated ranking that allows all players to see how they stack up against the rest of their region, no matter what their skill level is. In addition to providing rankings, GAR PR also provides match histories, allowing players to explore their full tournament history and local commentators to provide accurate insights on the history between two players.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h4>What rating system do you use?</h4>
    <p>Trueskill by Microsoft.</p>
    <h4>Where can I find out more about how Trueskill works?</h4>
    <p>
        Trueskill is a ranking system developed by Microsoft that is used for ranking players in many of their online Xbox Live titles. Check out the articles below to find out more about how Trueskill works:<br>

    </p>
    <h4>What tournament programs do you support?</h4>
    <p>Tio or Challonge.</p>
    <h4>How do you handle inactive players?</h4>
    <p>If a player is inactive for 45 days, they become hidden from the rankings list. They will still maintain the same rating they had before they became inactive. Once they enter another tournament, their old rating will be used to calculate their new rating and they will reappear on the rankings. Note that there is no rating decay of any kind.</p>
    <h4>How do you handle the same player entering multiple tournaments with different tags?</h4>
    <p>Merging player results are handled manually, ideally during tournament import time, but players can always be manually merged later. If you notice any players that need to be merged, contact me!</p>
    <h4>Do you take into account the set score (for example, 2-0 vs 2-1)?</h4>
    <p>No, only the match result (win or loss) is recorded.</p>
    <h4>Are round robin pools included?</h4>
    <p>In the beginning, I made a decision to not include round robin pools due to a variety of reasons. As of September 2014 however, I have started to include pools rseults. If you are a TO that submits tournament results to me, please make sure to record your pools electronically somehow (either in Tio or Challonge)!</p>
    <h4>How are out of region players handled?</h4>
    <p>Out of region players are handled just like any other player, except they are hidden permanently from the rankings list. They will still maintain a rating and match histories. A highly skilled out of region player entering a tournament in your region for the first time may have a slight effect on your rankings due to the player being treated as a brand new player, but their rating should converge fairly quickly as the tournament progresses.</p>
    <h4>Do you include majors (EVO, MLG, etc.) or other out-of-region tournaments that players in the region travel to?</h4>
    No. An out-of-region tournament would introduce too many out-of-region players, so the decision has been made to only include local tournaments.
    <h4>Can you include my region on GAR PR?</h4>
    <p>Definitely! Contact me.</p>
    <h4>Is GAR PR open source?</h4>
    <p>Yup! <a href="https://github.com/garsh0p/garpr">https://github.com/garsh0p/garpr</a>. Documentation is extremely lacking right now, however.</p>
    <h4>Can you add &lt;insert feature here&gt;?</h4>
    <p>If you have any feature suggestions, feel free to contact me!</p>
